- I'm Currently working as a Mechanical Design Engineer in an Office
- Full remote work opportunities in my expertise are harder to come by
- I have a minor in computer science that I don't get to apply as often as I'd like to
- So I'm teaching myself SQL in my free time, and I'm using this as a portfolio to showcase where I'm at with it
- I'm hoping this experience will also open up full remote work opportunities for myself in the future
